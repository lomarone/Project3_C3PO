# Project3: C3PO & R2
## By: Lauren Marone

### Document Info
I plan to create AI robots of C3PO and R2D2 from "Star Wars". They each are life-size and have a real-life purpose. C3PO is a translator and can speak any language in the galaxy, just like in the movies. R2 is a mechanic and displays holograms of things like movies or messages from people. Obviously, I cannot create these droids (yet), so the Arduino board and Processing code with stand in place of that. As you will see in my interaction diagram, I plan to have three outputs and inputs, one button that switches between C3PO and R2D2 (on-screen images), one potentiometer that when turned changes the language C3PO is speaking or the hologram that R2 is displaying, and one button that turns on an LED light that eventually will turn off once the droids need "charging".


### Audience
The audience for this project are Star Wars fans and geeks, mostly adults/teens. I want them to get the immersive experience of the Star Wars universe, right from home. These personal droids are customizable, to a point, and will help with anyones intergalactic travels.
